## Description

- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project was about creating a professional portfolio to showcase the projects and apps I've built throughout the class.  I came across multiple issues when creating my portfolio. The issues I ran into were utilizing and understanding props, and importing images from the DB I created. The importing of images for the projects and my own icon took the longest to find the answer however it was a very simple solution.  As for props I'm still getting used to using them but I'm hoping I'll continue to become more comfortable with them and eventually master them.
